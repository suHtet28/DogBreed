# Dog Breed Classification Project

Dog Breed Classification project is a small computer vision project made by my team "Byte Buddies".
It only have 13 dog breeds that it can classify and I have provided with train and test images.
We also created an streamlit app to utilize trained model.
There is also a model already trained by us if you don't want to train yourself and I have provided it for you as well.
This model use a pre-trained model MobileNetV2 which is from keras applications.
We added lime in extra to know what kind of technique did the model use to predict model.
Have fun using our project.
